#Why? 
#Services are implemented by one or more pods for Elasticity 
#and Resilience. In the cloud pods can come and go when there 
#are hardware failures or when pods get rescheduled onto 
#different nodes to improve resource utilisation.
#To use a service you need to dynamically discover the pods 
#implementing the service so that you can invoke it. 
#This is called service discovery.
